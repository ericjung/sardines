  SARDINES!
  By Eric H. Jung
  a week (or a few days) in April 2021
  
  For my adorable son, Elliot, on his 3rd birthday 2021-04-23, who likes to eat sardines with me.

  TITLE SCREEN that I want to add:

      The Dystopian Future

      The AI fishing bots have rebelled. No longer will they catch wild sardines off the coast of New Portugal.

      In order to satiate his craving, Elliot takes to the seven seas in search of his favorite delicacy.
      But there are sharks and kraken who would make a meal out of our hero given the chance.

      Fortunately, Elliot can eat crustaceans to smite his enemies and be victorious in his quest for ...

      SARDINES!
      

  Source code at https://github.com/ericjung/sardines but I only added it there after initial release.
  Originally developed for use with https://kaboomjs.com/ version 0.2 over a few days in April 2021.

  There are still some bugs with pausing/unpausing the game, and a some other things I'd like to add:

    * add birthday scene or special sprites Elliot's birthday
    * mobile/touch support (seems to be in kaboomJS 0.8! it was not for 0.2)
    * bonus round should be longer than 10 seconds and it needs more details
    * don't spawn next right next to enemies!
    * high scores (requires backend web service with database)
    * treasure chest random appearances -- big points!
    * snail. similar to the crab, he crawls on the sea floor. when touched, the player slows down for a period of time.
    * change background music when crab is touched to indicate god mode (like when pac-man eats a power-up)
    * other sea creature which, when touched, the player speeds up for a period of time.
    * better sea floor; e.g. with sand, shells, etc. not just seweed
    * multiplayer?
    * Fewer sharks on the first level. Number of sharks should increase linearly as the levels increase or as score increases
    * Longer bonus round but add a jaws-style shark who lunges from the bottom of the screen to try to eat you
    * change seaweed to be thin strands, like kelp, with crab going behind and in front
    * lew zealand from the muppets -- put into the game somehow

    * bonus round art ideas:
      * davy jones's locker
      * love boat
      * octopus's garden
      * atlantis
      * island with palm tree
      * skeleton pirates
      * change seaweed to be thin strangds with crab going behind / in front
      * lew zealand from the muppets -- put into the game somehow
