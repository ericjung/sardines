**For my adorable son, Elliot, on his 3rd birthday 2021-04-23, and who likes to eat sardines with me.**
  
## A Dystopian Future

The AI fishing bots have rebelled. No longer will they catch wild sardines off the coast of New Portugal.  

In order to satiate his craving, Elliot takes to the seven seas in search of his favorite delicacy. But there are sharks ðŸ¦ˆ and kraken <img src="sprites/kracken.png" width="2%"/> who would make a meal out of our hero given the chance.  

Fortunately, Elliot can eat crustaceans ðŸ¦€ to smite his enemies and be victorious in his quest for ...

<h1>SARDINES!</h1>

Originally developed for use with https://kaboomjs.com/ version 0.2 over a few days in April 2021.  
Unfortunately, mobile devices are not yet supported. There are still some bugs with pausing/unpausing the game, and some other things I'd like to add.   

- There's a bug whereby Elliot's voice calling out "SARDINES!" no longer plays on the title screen. Instead it plays during the into music - not good.
- Support mobile (port to the newest version of KaboomJS or port to https://phaser.io/)
- add birthday scene or special sprites only on Elliot's birthday
- mobile/touch support (seems to be in kaboomJS 0.8! it was not for 0.2)
- bonus round should be longer than 10 seconds and it needs more details
- don't spawn next right next to enemies!
- high scores (requires backend web service with database)
- treasure chest random appearances -- big points!
- snail. similar to the crab, he crawls on the sea floor. when touched, the player slows down for a period of time.
- change background music when crab is touched to indicate god mode (like when pac-man eats a power-up)
- other sea creature which, when touched, the player speeds up for a period of time.
- better sea floor; e.g. with sand, shells, etc. not just seweed
- multiplayer?
- Fewer sharks on the first level. Number of sharks should increase linearly as the levels increase or as score increases
- Longer bonus round but add a jaws-style shark who lunges from the bottom of the screen to try to eat you (from Quinn)
- change seaweed to be thin strands, like kelp, with crab going behind and in front (from Quinn)
- lew zealand from the muppets -- put into the game somehow (from Quinn)
- adjustable sprite speed for easier/harder game play

The bonus round needs some work. Here are some bonus round art ideas. Some of these are from Quinn or Michael  
- davy jones's locker
- love boat
- octopus's garden
- atlantis
- island with palm tree
- skeleton pirates
- change seaweed to be thin strangds with crab going behind / in front
- lew zealand from the muppets -- put into the game somehow
